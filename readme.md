# Book Search Engine Starter Code

During this challenge I had the opportuntiy to do the Social Network API challegnge. Over class and reaching out to tutors and peers I was able to get some of the work done. With the final project coming up I'm trying to master this information to the best of my ability so I can assist my team in every way possible. It's been pretty challenging so far, but at the end of the day it's been rewarding. As I'm still working on this challenge, I wanted to submit what I could as my team is starting to work towards the final project. When my team and I aren't working on that project I'll be able to come back to this and continue finalizing this challenge.
